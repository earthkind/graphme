# graphme
Empower people through instant, permissionless, and modular connection

#### Problem
Our social graphs are siloed across different applications, which (1) limits the ways we connect with our worlds, (2) locks us into service providers, and (3) creates friction and complexity when trying to connect.

#### Example Patches

* User can **read** social graph from an existing application (e.g. social network, email provider, messaging application) and **create** their own instance of that social graph
* User can **create** a messaging thread with connectionsÂ on self-owned social graphs
